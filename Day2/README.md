# 🌌 Deploying a Static Web App on AWS EC2
 
 This repository showcases the complete process I followed to deploy a static HTML login page on an **AWS EC2 Ubuntu instance**. It walks through launching the instance, configuring security, setting up Apache2, and deploying a basic HTML file.

 ## 🚀 What I Did
 
 - Launched and configured an Ubuntu EC2 instance
 - Created key pairs and security groups
 - Connected to the instance using PuTTY
 - Installed and configured Apache2 web server
 - Deployed a static HTML login page

 ## 🚪 Launch EC2 Instance
 
 1. Go to EC2 Dashboard on AWS
 2. Launch a new instance with the following:
    - **Name**: MyStaticWebApp
    - **OS**: Ubuntu
    - **Instance Type**: t2.small (you can change as per app size)
 3. Create a **key pair**:
    - Choose format: `.ppk` for PuTTY
    - Select RSA and download it
 4. Create a **security group**:
    - Allow port **80** (HTTP) and **22** (SSH)
 5. Choose storage (e.g., 15GB)
 6. Launch the instance

 ## 🔑 Connect via PuTTY (Windows)
 
 1. Download and install PuTTY
 2. Open PuTTY and do the following:
    - **Host Name**: Use your EC2 public IP
    - Under `SSH > Auth`, **browse your .ppk key file**
    - Click `Open` and accept security prompt
 3. Once connected, switch to root:
 
 ```bash
 sudo -i
 ```
 
 4. Update the server:
 
 ```bash
 apt update -y
 ```

 ## 🏢 Install Apache2 and Setup Web Server
 
 ```bash
 apt install apache2 -y
 ```
 
 Check status:
 
 ```bash
 service apache2 status
 ```
 
 If inactive, restart Apache:
 
 ```bash
 service apache2 restart
 ```
 
 Navigate to the default root directory:
 
 ```bash
 cd /var/www/html
 ```
 
 Remove default page and create new index:
 
 ```bash
 rm index.html
 nano index.html
 ```
 
 Copy-paste HTML login page code (from [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com)) into the file. Use:
 
 - Press `i` to insert text
 - Paste your HTML code
 - Save and exit using:
 
 ```bash
 ESC + :wq + Enter
 ```
 
 Restart Apache again:
 
 ```bash
 service apache2 restart
 ```

 ## 🔍 View Your Static Web App
 
 Open your browser and go to:
 
 ```
 http://<your-ec2-public-ip>
 ```
 
 Make sure your EC2 security group has port **80** enabled to allow traffic.
 
 You should now see your **HTML login page** hosted from your EC2 instance! 🌐
